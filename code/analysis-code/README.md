# analysis-code

This folder contains two R script files as listed below. 

*statistical-analysis*: This file includes descriptive analysis and mediation effect analysis. All analysis in this code file are right targeting the research goal.

*ML-analysis*: This file includes application of regression tree and random forest. Everything in this file is a little off the research target and just to show some concepts from this class.

These code files are only implemented as R scripts, no Quarto version.
