# analysis-code

This folder contains three R script files as listed below. 

*statistical-analysis*: This file includes descriptive analysis and mediation effect analysis. All analysis in this code file are right targeting the research goal.

*ML-analysis*: This file includes application of regression tree and random forest. Everything in this file is a little off the research target and just to show some concepts from this class.

*simulation-analysis*: This file generates simulated data to further evaluate the performance of the random forest model. This is like inflating the sample size for ML application. 

These code files are only implemented as R scripts, no Quarto version.
